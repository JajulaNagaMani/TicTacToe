# TicTacToe
# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player game built using Java Swing. This desktop application allows two users to play the classic game of Tic Tac Toe (also known as Noughts and Crosses) on a 3x3 grid. The interface is graphical and interactive, using buttons to represent each cell of the board.

Players take turns marking a cell with either X or O. The game automatically checks for a winner after every move and displays a message when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw. After the result is shown, the game board resets so players can start a new game immediately.

This project is ideal for beginners learning Java GUI development and basic game logic.
# TOOLS USED FOR MY PROJECT

Swing (Java GUI)	     Java library used to build the graphical user interface
IntelliJ IDEA	         Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used to write, debug, and run the project
Git	                   Version control system used to track changes in your project
GitHub	               Online platform used to host and share your code repository
# HOW MY PROJECT WORKS
This Tic Tac Toe game is a two-player game (Player X and Player O) developed using Java Swing. Here's how the game works step by step:

1. Game Startup
When you run the project (via IntelliJ IDEA or command line), a window opens showing a 3x3 grid.

The grid is made of 9 buttons, representing the 9 cells of the Tic Tac Toe board.

2. Taking Turns
The game starts with Player X.

Players take turns by clicking any empty button (cell).

After X plays, it becomes Player O's turn, and so on.

3. Marking Moves
When a player clicks a button:

The button displays "X" or "O" based on whose turn it is.

"X" is shown in blue, "O" is shown in red for better visibility.

4. Checking for a Winner
After every move, the game checks:

If any row, column, or diagonal has the same symbol (X or O), then that player wins.

If all 9 cells are filled and there's no winner, it's a draw.

5. Game Result
If there's a winner:

A popup message shows: "X wins!" or "O wins!"

If it's a draw:

A popup shows: "It's a draw!"

6. Game Reset
After showing the result, the board resets automatically.

Players can start a new game immediately without restarting the program.

Open IntelliJ IDEA.
# SUMMARY OF MY PROJECT
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game that I developed using Java and Swing for the graphical user interface. I built and tested the project entirely in IntelliJ IDEA, and then uploaded it to GitHub for version control and submission. The application opens a window with a 3x3 grid made of buttons, where two players can take turns by clicking the cells to place their mark—X or O. The game keeps track of whose turn it is and highlights X in blue and O in red for better visual clarity. After each move, the program automatically checks whether a player has won by completing a row, column, or diagonal. If a player wins, a popup message shows the winner and the board resets automatically for a new game. If all cells are filled and there’s no winner, the game declares a draw and resets the board. The project helped me understand event handling, basic game logic, and GUI development in Java. After finishing the game, I saved the project in a folder and uploaded it to GitHub by dragging the files into my repository. I then copied the GitHub link and submitted it to MICRO IT as part of my assignment.
